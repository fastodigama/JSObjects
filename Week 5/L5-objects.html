    <h1 id="firstH1">JavaScript Objects</h1> <!-- OVERVIEW --> 
    <h2>What are objects for?</h2> 
    <p id="par1">An object is a container of related properties that act as a metaphor for an element of reality (an “entity”) in our code. More powerful than an array (a collection of related values), objects can <em>do</em> things.</p> <!-- KEY CONCEPTS --> 
    <h2>The Big 5 Concepts</h2> 
    <ol> 
      <li>An object in a computer program acts as a metaphor for a real world entity.</li> 
      <li>The object is a list of key:value pairs (“properties”) that contain data relevant to the object in the program.</li> 
      <li>We can get or set the values of these properties through “dot notation”.</li> 
      <li>Objects can have functions (“methods”) as values.</li> 
      <li>An object's methods are typically used to modify the object.</li> 
    </ol>
